And I'm a digital artist and consultant, with over 15 years experience enabling companies to create specialised projects, where ... skillset is needed.

I'm a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/ruth-john), am on the board of directors for [Bath Digital Festival](https://bathdigitalfestival.co.uk/) and in my career have worked for companies such as o2 (Telefonica) and BSkyB, and clients such as the BBC, NBC, Cancer Research UK, Heineken and Channel 4 among others.

I also helped co-found <code>[{ Live : JS }](https://livejs.network)</code> - a collective, which brings audio and visual code to life, in live performances across the globe.

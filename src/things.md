My things are here

Everything is in folders based on the data taxonomy

So talks & workshops are together because I would need to input the same data for them.

Display as such:

Everything on one page - colour code the following categories:
-  work/projects -> pro_
-  talks/workshops -> tw_
-  publications (articles, interviews, podcasts, judge) -> pub_

maybe everything is one big category - with filters - have I been here before

CV section as well - with awards, positions, director, founder, judge etc...

Work with me - I think web audio and midi workshops need a separate thing - same site tho? workshops.ruthjohn.com

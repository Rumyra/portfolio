    <h2>What</h2>

    <p class="note">It's both an afternoon garden party <i>and</i> an evening shindig! Drop by when you want and stay for as long as you want!</p>

    <h3>Garden Party from 2pm</h3>

    <p>Chill out with some pimms and snacks. Don't worry if you've got little ones - loads of guests do! They'll be party food and there's playing fields and a play area right next to the hall.</p>

    <h3>Evening Shindig 6pm onwards</h3>

    <p>Bring your own! There'll be evening food and some provided drinks, but bring with you what you need. There's no license to sell alcohol but you can bring whatever you want.</p>

    <h2>Where</h2>

    <p class="sub--callout text--lede"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/toeGbE36o5cUSWCP9">Yatton Keynell Village Hall</a>. Just off Junction 17 of the m4. I'll update with detailed directions nearer the time.</p>

    <h2>When</h2>

    <p class="sub--callout text--lede">Saturday 2nd October - save the date!</p>

    <h2>RSVP</h2>

    <p>You're welcome to bring whoever you want, it's an open house, but please only share this link via email or direct message, thanks.</p>

    <p class="text--lede">Let Ruth know whether it's a yes, no or maybe as soon as pos so she can book in food and drinks.</p>

    <h3>Places to stay</h3>

    <p>There's plenty of places to stay near Yatton Keynell, depending on your price range. Whilst the end of September is probably not peak season, it's also a good idea to book in advance.</p>

    <p>Cheap and cheerful: <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/wiltshire/chippenham/chippenham.html">Premier Inn, Chippenham</a> or <a href="https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/652/Chippenham-hotel">Travelodge Chippenham</a></p>

    <p>Posher: <a href="https://guyershouse.com/hotel/">Guyer's House</a></p>

    <h3>Taxis home</h3>

    <p>It's probably a good idea to book a cab in advance. I'll be talking to some taxi companies closer to the event to make sure people can get back to hotels.</p>
